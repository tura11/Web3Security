## About the Project

A festival NFT ecosystem on Ethereum where users purchase tiered passes (ERC1155), attend virtual(or not) performances to earn BEAT tokens (ERC20), and redeem unique memorabilia NFTs (integrated in the same ERC1155 contract) using BEAT tokens.

## Actors

Organizer: Configures performances and memorabilia.

Attendee: Customer that buys a pass and attends performances. They use rewards received for attending performances to buy memorabilia.

## Known Issues

- Owner and Organizer are trusted.
- Some checks were left out for gas efficiency.
- The uri address we used inside the ERC1155 constructor is provisional, we will deal with that closer to live deployment.
